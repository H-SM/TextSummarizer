Worry about supply. Worry that the company may not be producing those darn AI processors fast enough.

Nvidia never really started an artificial intelligence company the way OpenAI and so many others like it did. It started out as a company that produced graphic cards for video games, and for a long, long time, this is what Nvidia was known for.

Little did Nvidia know that this technology would then serve as the backbone of LLMs, instantly transforming it as the arms dealer of choice in corporations&apos; pursuit of the perfect AI. as Nvidia may very well be out of touch with its roots, but that&apos;s hardly what shareholders care about. And if Nvidia shareholders don&apos;t care about the gamers, then Nvidia doesn&apos;t care about the gamers.

boy did Wall Street go crazy And with crazy comes worry Worry about a monopoly Worry about supply Worry that the company may not be producing those darn AI processors fast enough But for Nvidia it is
