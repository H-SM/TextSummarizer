in this project, I design and train a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions . in this case, LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) is used which is a special kind of RNN that includes a memory cell, in order to maintain the information for a longer period of time . tokenizing Captions First, we iterate through all of the training captions . we create a dictionary that maps all unique words to a numerical index . each word we come across will have a corresponding integer value .
